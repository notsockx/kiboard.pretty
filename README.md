KiCad footprints that I use for my keyboard projects. <br/>

# Switch Footprints
##Models
- Cherry MX
- Kailh PG1350
##Variants 
- Reversible: Allows for placement of the switch on either side of the PCB.
- Cutout: Allows for the PCB to double as a plate by having a partially cut hole where the switch sits.
Note: Cutout footprints are not available to PG1350 footprints because of how low profile they are.
